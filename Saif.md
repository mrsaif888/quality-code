1. [the Business Impact of Code Quality](https://www.infoq.com/articles/business-impact-code-quality/)
This article emphasizes the significant impact of technical debt in software development on both business and developer well-being. Here's a concise summary:
Technical debt is a business risk that consumes 23-42% of developers' time, affecting not only finances but also job satisfaction.
Difficulty in conveying the value of code quality improvements to non-technical stakeholders arises because code is abstract.
To address technical debt effectively, it suggests using a "code health" measure that demonstrates its impact on time-to-market and unplanned work.
Prioritizing technical debt based on an "interest rate" through Hotspot analysis ensures actionable and relevant results.
The article emphasizes setting business expectations for code quality improvements, resulting in shorter development times and reduced uncertainty in project estimates.
Despite the recognized importance of code quality, the lack of data and numbers to prove its value has led to an undervaluation of a healthy codebase at the business level.
Recent research reveals tangible business advantages, including doubled development speed, 15 times fewer bugs, and significant reductions in project completion time uncertainty, making the case for prioritizing code quality improvement strategies.

Check list

1: Recognize Technical Debt as a Business Risk:

2: Acknowledge that technical debt can waste developers' time and impact job satisfaction.
Understand that its implications go beyond financial costs and can affect overall business performance.
Translate Code Quality into Business Value:

3: Recognize that code quality is often abstract to non-technical stakeholders.
Develop strategies to communicate the business impact of improved code quality.
Implement Code Health Measures:

Establish metrics and indicators to quantify and track code health.
Use these measures to make technical debt more accessible and understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

2. [Developers, unite! Join the fight for code quality](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3691011/developers-unite-join-the-fight-for-code-quality.html)
 Quality in software development is vital for several reasons. It ensures value delivery to clients and users, safeguards a company's brand reputation, upholds craftsmanship, and meets ethical responsibilities. Advocating for quality involves building consensus with leadership, framing concerns in business interests, understanding their perspective, relying on facts, and being open to compromise. If a company consistently prioritizes velocity over quality, it may be time to consider whether it's the right workplace for fostering professional growth and writing good code.

1: Quality for Value and Success:

Advocate for code quality to ensure that software delivers value to users.
Understand that software is meant to be used by people, and buggy or unreliable code fails to deliver that value.
Recognize that technical debt can hinder long-term success, making it essential to prioritize code quality from the start.

2: Quality for Brand Protection:

Realize that code quality also protects your employer's brand reputation.
Poorly implemented code can harm your company's reputation and erode trust among users.
Understand that one or two unsuccessful product launches can damage your brand's equity and lead to financial consequences.

3: Quality as a Craft and Responsibility:

View writing code as a craft that deserves respect and attention.
Advocate for an environment that values the intricacies of software development.
Recognize that quality code is a long-term investment in your career and contributes to business success.
Emphasize the ethical responsibility of building products that meet the highest professional standards and do no harm.

3. [Improve Code Quality with These Tips and Best Practices](https://dev.to/documatic/improve-code-quality-with-these-tips-and-best-practices-2mh2)
In software development, code quality is paramount for reliability and maintainability. This article emphasizes the importance of writing clean, readable code and provides practical tips for achieving better code quality. Key recommendations include adhering to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, writing modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, avoiding hard-coded values, using version control, refactoring regularly, and optimizing for performance. Improving code quality ultimately leads to more efficient and manageable software development.

Check list 

1: Prioritizing Code Quality:
Recognize that code quality is not just about functionality but also readability, maintainability, and user experience.
Understand that writing high-quality code initially reduces the need for future code rewrites and leads to fewer bugs.
Highlight the benefits of clean code, such as faster development and easier maintenance.

2: Principles for Better Code:
Embrace coding principles like "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) to prioritize simplicity and reduce complexity.
Promote modularity by identifying and extracting code modules for reusability, making the codebase more maintainable.
Follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle to eliminate duplicate code and maintain consistency.

3: Tools and Best Practices:
Encourage the use of version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate effectively, and ensure code integrity.
Promote code refactoring as a means to continuously improve code quality by addressing code smells and enhancing readability.
Highlight the importance of optimizing code for performance using profiling tools, efficient algorithms, caching, and reduced I/O operations.

Summary 
Code quality tools validate your code for consistency with a coding standard of your choice. You can appoint one of the predefined coding standards or use your own previously defined coding standard. If you are using the awesome PHPStorm and you should, you can easily integrate it with the code quality tools.
Check list 

1: Code Quality Tool Integration:

Choose a code quality tool that aligns with your project's coding standards and requirements.
Ensure that the selected code quality tool can be easily integrated with PHPStorm, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for PHP.
Follow the integration instructions provided by PHPStorm to seamlessly incorporate the code quality tool into your development workflow.

2: Coding Standards Selection:

Decide whether to adopt predefined coding standards provided by the code quality tool or create a custom coding standard tailored to your project's needs.
When using predefined standards, familiarize yourself with the specific rules and guidelines they enforce to maintain consistency in your codebase.
If opting for a custom coding standard, define clear and comprehensive guidelines that address code formatting, naming conventions, and other relevant aspects.

3: Benefits of Integration:

Highlight the advantages of integrating code quality tools with PHPStorm, such as automated code validation and consistency checks.
Emphasize how code quality tools can help identify and rectify code issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving code maintainability.
Showcase the impact of code quality improvements on overall project quality, readability, and collaboration within your development team.
