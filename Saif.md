1. [the Business Impact of Code Quality](https://www.infoq.com/articles/business-impact-code-quality/)
This article emphasizes the significant impact of technical debt in software development on both business and developer well-being. Here's a concise summary:
Technical debt is a business risk that consumes 23-42% of developers' time, affecting not only finances but also job satisfaction.
Difficulty in conveying the value of code quality improvements to non-technical stakeholders arises because code is abstract.
To address technical debt effectively, it suggests using a "code health" measure that demonstrates its impact on time-to-market and unplanned work.
Prioritizing technical debt based on an "interest rate" through Hotspot analysis ensures actionable and relevant results.
The article emphasizes setting business expectations for code quality improvements, resulting in shorter development times and reduced uncertainty in project estimates.
Despite the recognized importance of code quality, the lack of data and numbers to prove its value has led to an undervaluation of a healthy codebase at the business level.
Recent research reveals tangible business advantages, including doubled development speed, 15 times fewer bugs, and significant reductions in project completion time uncertainty, making the case for prioritizing code quality improvement strategies.
